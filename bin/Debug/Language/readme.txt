==== Read this file before starting your translation ====

* all lines starting with '!', or with a space character ' ' will be ignored
* so you can add comments lines by starting it with a '!'
* all empty lines are ignored
* number sequence is important, don't change the number orders, and don't mix the leading numbers
* please refer to the English language file for leading number sequence
* don't add anything else at the end of number-lead lines
* DON'T translate lines marked by 'Don't translate the next line', these lines are the key lines

* Please include your contact information in your translation file so people can know this is your work
* You may add extra comments lines to your translation file for other useful purposes

* Regarding filename:
* In general, you should use the language name in its own language as the filename, end with '.lng'
* Such filenames may be not loadable by the Windows/OS in other languages
* You can also name the file in english, so everyone can access it.
* If a language file is loadable, the filename will be used in the language selection menu
* regardless of the current selected language

* length for menu item usually does not matter since menu has always enough space to display the strings
* length for dialog item texts must be paid special attention because the dialog item text
* space is limited, you should try to use the shortest translation or acronyms.
* Since you may not have the beta 1964.exe to test your translation with, please do your best
* for the moment, and test your translation when it is available for you.
